# Human Acitivity Recognition using Smartphones
Version 1.0
==================================================================

This data contains smartphone sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) of a number of volunteers, each performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). 

Only those variables relating to mean or standard devation were used in this analysis.
They were selected based on column names containing the keywords "mean" or "std"
You can find a full list of these variables with description in the CodeBook.md file


# The repo contains these files:
=========================================

* 'README.md'

* 'CodeBook.md': Shows information about the variables used.

* 'run_analysis.R': Script used to clean and create the mean dataset

* 'dataset.txt': Tab-delimited file containing cleaned data with variable means by subject and activity
